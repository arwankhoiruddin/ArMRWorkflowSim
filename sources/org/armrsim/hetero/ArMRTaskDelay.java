/**
 * This class manages delay due to task speculation happens in MapReduce
 *
 * In Hadoop, MapReduce breaks jobs into tasks and these tasks run parallel rather than sequential, thus reduces overall execution time.
 * This model of execution is sensitive to slow tasks (even if they are few in numbers) as they slow down the overall execution of a job.
 * There may be various reasons for the slowdown of tasks, including hardware degradation or software misconfiguration,
 * but it may be difficult to detect causes since the tasks still complete successfully,
 * although more time is taken than the expected time. Hadoop doesnâ€™t try to diagnose and fix slow running tasks,
 * instead, it tries to detect them and runs backup tasks for them. This is called speculative execution in Hadoop.
 * These backup tasks are called Speculative tasks in Hadoop.
